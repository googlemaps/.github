// AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION AND SERVICE
/**
 * Service Description: The Routes Preferred API.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (RoutesPreferredClient routesPreferredClient = RoutesPreferredClient.create()) {
 *   Waypoint origin = Waypoint.newBuilder().build();
 *   Waypoint destination = Waypoint.newBuilder().build();
 *   ComputeRoutesRequest request = ComputeRoutesRequest.newBuilder()
 *     .setOrigin(origin)
 *     .setDestination(destination)
 *     .build();
 *   ComputeRoutesResponse response = routesPreferredClient.computeRoutes(request);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the routesPreferredClient object to clean up resources
 * such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls
 * close().
 *
 * <p>The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li> A "flattened" method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   <li> A "request object" method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   <li> A "callable" method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of RoutesPreferredSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * RoutesPreferredSettings routesPreferredSettings =
 *     RoutesPreferredSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * RoutesPreferredClient routesPreferredClient =
 *     RoutesPreferredClient.create(routesPreferredSettings);
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * RoutesPreferredSettings routesPreferredSettings =
 *     RoutesPreferredSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * RoutesPreferredClient routesPreferredClient =
 *     RoutesPreferredClient.create(routesPreferredSettings);
 * </code>
 * </pre>

  /**
   * Returns the primary route along with optional alternate routes, given a set of terminal and
   * intermediate waypoints.
   *
   * <p>&#42;&#42;NOTE:&#42;&#42; This method requires that you specify a response field mask in the
   * input. You can provide the response field mask by using URL parameter `$fields` or `fields`, or
   * by using an HTTP/gRPC header `X-Goog-FieldMask` (see the [available URL parameters and
   * headers](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/system-parameters). The value is a comma separated
   * list of field paths. See detailed documentation about [how to construct the field
   * paths](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/field_mask.proto).
   *
   * <p>For example, in this method:
   *
   * <p>&#42; Field mask of all available fields (for manual inspection): `X-Goog-FieldMask: &#42;`
   * &#42; Field mask of Route-level duration, distance, and polyline (an example production setup):
   * `X-Goog-FieldMask: routes.duration,routes.distanceMeters,routes.polyline`
   *
   * <p>Google discourage the use of the wildcard (`&#42;`) response field mask, or specifying the
   * field mask at the top level (`routes`), because:
   *
   * <p>&#42; Selecting only the fields that you need helps our server save computation cycles,
   * allowing us to return the result to you with a lower latency. &#42; Selecting only the fields
   * that you need in your production job ensures stable latency performance. We might add more
   * response fields in the future, and those new fields might require extra computation time. If
   * you select all fields, or if you select all fields at the top level, then you might experience
   * performance degradation because any new field we add will be automatically included in the
   * response. &#42; Selecting only the fields that you need results in a smaller response size, and
   * thus higher network throughput.
   *
   * <p>Sample code:
   *
   * <pre><code>
   * try (RoutesPreferredClient routesPreferredClient = RoutesPreferredClient.create()) {
   *   Waypoint origin = Waypoint.newBuilder().build();
   *   Waypoint destination = Waypoint.newBuilder().build();
   *   ComputeRoutesRequest request = ComputeRoutesRequest.newBuilder()
   *     .setOrigin(origin)
   *     .setDestination(destination)
   *     .build();
   *   ComputeRoutesResponse response = routesPreferredClient.computeRoutes(request);
   * }
   * </code></pre>
   *
   * @param request The request object containing all of the parameters for the API call.
   * @throws com.google.api.gax.rpc.ApiException if the remote call fails
